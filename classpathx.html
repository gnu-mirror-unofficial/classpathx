<p>
The <i>GNU Classpath Extensions</i> project, aka <i>classpathx</i>
builds free versions of Oracle's Java extension libraries, the packages
in the <code>javax</code> namespace.
It is a companion project of the 
<a href='/software/classpath/'>GNU Classpath</a> project.
</p>

<p>
classpathx produces vendor neutral Java code: it should work with
any VM. However, we particularly want the code to work with free VMs
such as <a href='http://gcc.gnu.org/java'>gij</a>,
<a href='http://jamvm.sourceforge.net/'>JamVM</a>,
<a href='http://www.kaffe.org/'>kaffe</a>, and
<a href='http://www.cacaojvm.org/'>CACAO</a>.
Ideally classpathx code should also work under Dalvik in Android: if you
find incompatibilities in this area please log a bug report.
</p>

<h3><a name='help-wanted'>Getting involved</a></h3>

<p>
Attempting to build free versions of the entire javax namespace
is a big job and we need your help to get everything done. If you are
a Java programmer and you want to work on building free Java
extensions then get in touch with
<a href='mailto:dog@gnu.org'>Chris Burdess</a>
who will be happy to give you something interesting to do!
</p>

<p>
If you want to write code you must assure us that you have not seen the
source code for any implementations you want to work on that are
distributed under a non-copyleft license. GNU classpathx libraries are
clean room implementations of javax APIs. If you have worked with OpenJDK
or other source code distributed under multiple licences that include the
GPL, that will be fine.
</p>

<p>
If you can't contribute code, either because you don't think you're
qualified or you've seen proprietary source code, you can still be of
tremendous help to us. We need testers and people to write
documentation as well as hackers!
</p>

<p>
You can also browse our
<a href='https://savannah.gnu.org/task/?group=classpathx'>task list</a>
for ideas about what needs to be done.

<h3>Current modules</h3>

<dl>

<dt><a name='activation' href='jaf/jaf.html'>JavaBeans&trade; Activation
Framework</a></dt>
<dd>
JAF provides a means to type data and locate components suitable for
performing various kinds of action on it. It extends the UNIX standard
<code>mime.types</code> and <code>mailcap</code> mechanisms for Java.
We have a complete implementation of JAF 1.1.
</dd>

<dt><a name='mail' href='javamail/javamail.html'>JavaMail</a></dt>
<dd>
JavaMail provides a complete internet mail system, including MIME.
We have a complete implementation of JavaMail 1.3, and a broad range of
providers including the only JavaMail NNTP provider and Maildir provider.
</dd>

<dt><a name="servlet">Servlet API</a></dt>
<dd>
An extensible framework for building web applications.
We are working on version 3.0 of the servlet specification.
There are various servlet containers using the classpathx servlet API,
including 
<a href="/software/paperclips">Paperclips</a> and
<a href='http://nongnu.org/gumdrop/'>gumdrop</a>.
</dd>

<dt><a name='infobus'>JavaBean infobus</a></dt>
<dd>
The infobus is a bean-to-bean communication system.
We have the API classes but no implementations yet.
</dd>

</dl>

<h3>classpathx alumni</h3>

<p>
The following projects started development within classpathx, and as they
became more stable and feature complete moved to become their own separate
projects.
</p>

<dl>

<dt><a name='jaxp'>GNU JAXP</a></dt>
<dd>
Java XML APIs and implementations, including parsers and XSLT transformations.
This project has moved to the
<a href='/software/classpath/'>GNU Classpath</a> project.
</dd>

<dt><a name='crypto'>Java Cryptography</a></dt>
<dd>
This project has moved to become the <a
href='/software/gnu-crypto/'>GNU-Crypto</a> project.
</dd>

</dl>

<h3><a name='releases'>Releases</a></h3>

<p>
Each classpathx module is distributed as a separate library or set of
libraries.
</p>

<h3><a name='development'>Development</a></h3>

<p>
Development for classpathx occurs on the 
<a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/classpathx">savannah</a>
free software collaboration system. You can view our source code from
there. If you want to help us you will need to become a savannah user.

<p>
Andrew Selkirk started this project as an open source effort in
2000. He did all of the hard work creating the free versions of the various
javax APIs listed above. He was also gracious enough to hand on the
work to the GNU project when he found himself too busy to
continue. Andrew stays in touch with the project and we'd like to give a 
a <b>very</b> big thank you to Andrew for his effort, vision 
and magnanimity.
</p>

<p>
David Brownell contributed the JAXP, SAX and DOM code.
With another hat, he's a maintainer for the SAX2 interfaces.
Thanks for the help David!
</p>

<p>
Chris Burdess wrote the JavaMail and JAF implementations and
providers, the JAXP streaming and XSLT implementations.
</p>

<p>
Paul Siegmann, who wrote the original free version of the servlet API 
and trailblazed the legalities of the GNU project clean rooming javax
source code. Paul spent many days typing in code worked out from
javadoc. He deserves a lot of thanks, so...<br>
Lots of thanks Paul!
