<p>The <i>GNU Classpath Extensions</i> project builds free versions of Sun's
java extension libraries, the packages in the <code>javax</code>
namespace. It is a companion project of the 
<a href="/software/classpath/">GNU Classpath</a> project.
</p>

<p>Classpathx produces vendor neutral java code, it should work with
any VM. However, we particularly want the code to work with free VMs
such as <a href="http://www.kaffe.org/">kaffe</a>.
</p>


<br>
<h4>We need help</h4>

<p>Attempting to build free versions of ALL of Sun's java extensions
is a big job and we need your help to get everything done. If you are
a Java programmer and you want to work on building free java
extensions then get in touch with 
<a href="mailto:nferrier@gnu.org">Nic Ferrier
(nferrier@gnu.org)</a>. He'll be happy to give you something
interesting to do!
</p>

<p>If you want to help us develop code you must assure us that you
have not seen the source code for the API you want to work on. If you
have seen Sun's source code we can't accept your contributions as they
would put the entire project at risk from legal action.
</p>

<p>If you can't contribute code, either because you don't think you're
qualified or you've seen Sun's source code, you can still be of
tremendous help to us. We need testers and people to write
documentation as well as hackers!
</p>


<br>
<h4>Keep in touch</h4>

<p>To know what's going on with the project you can subscribe to our
very low volume <i>announcements</i> mailing list by sending a mail with the
subject line:
<pre>
  subscribe
</pre>
to the address 
<a href="mailto:classpathx-annouce-request@gnu.org">classpathx-announce-request@gnu.org</a>.
</p>

<p>If you are interested in becomming a developer it may be usefull to
track one of the development mailing lists. There is a mailing list
for each major project. Check the individual project pages (or the
savannah system) for more info. There is a general discussion list for
classpathx developers which you can join by sending a mail with the
subject:
<pre>
  subscribe
</pre>
to the address <a href="mailto:classpathx-discuss-request@gnu.org">classpathx-discuss-request@gnu.org</a>.

<h4>Packages currently under development</h4>

<ul>
<li><a id="jbactivation" href="jaf/jaf.html">java beans 
activation framework</a><br>
LGPL licenced.<br>
The activation framework allows programmers to encapsulate access to
certain types of data.<br>
We have the API classes but no implementations yet.
<p></p>
</li>

<li><a id="jbinfobus">java bean infobus</a><br>
LGPL licenced.<br>
The infobus is a bean->bean communication system.<br>
We have the API classes but no implementations yet.
<p></p>
</li>

<li><a id="jcrypto" href="crypto/crypto.html">java cryptology</a><br>
GPL + library exception<br>
The cryptology library covers all aspects of java crypto. We are
concentrating on building crypto implementations before writing
implementations of Java crypto APIs (such as the JCE).
<p></p>
</li>

<li><a id="jmail">java mail</a><br>
LGPL licenced.<br>
Everything you need to send mail from a java program</br>
We have got quite a lot of the API classes for this. We also have the
following providers finished or underway:
  <ul>
  <li>POP provider</li>
  <li>MBOX provider</li>
  <li>NNTP provider</li>
  <li>IMAP provider</li>
  <li>SMTP provider</li>
  </ul>
<p></p>
</li>

<li><a id="jaxp" href="jaxp/jaxp.html">jaxp</a>
... the core <em>Java API for XML Processing</em>.<br />
License: GPL with "library exception".<br />
We have JAXP 1.1 interfaces, and current SAX2 and DOM Level 2
interfaces from their maintainers.<br />
The SAX2 implementation uses the &AElig;lfred2 parser,
including modular validation.<br />
The DOM Level 2 implementation is "DOM2". <br />
There are related <code>gnu.xml.*</code> packages.
<p></p>
</li>

<li><a id="net">net extensions</a><br>
GPL licenced.<br>
The extended net API which provides certain extensions to java.net.<br>
We have some of the API including a default implementation relying on
<code>java.net</code> code.
<p></p>
</li>

<li><a id="servlet">servlet API</a><br>
LGPL licenced.<br>
The abstract definition of how to plug executable content into
HTTP.</br>
We have the servlet classes for version 2.3 of the API (we'd like to
produce the previous versions of these as well).<br>
There is also a GNU servlet container called 
<a href="/software/paperclips">Paperclips</a>.
<p></p>
</li>

</ul>


<br>
<h4>Releases</h4>
<p>Releases for each separate part of the ClasspathX project are
maintained, well, seperately. Check each project's page for details.
</p>

<p>We do not plan to offer a full ClasspathX download, but if you'd be
interested in having one you should maybe let 
<a href="mailto: classpathx-discuss@gnu.org">us</a> know.
</p>


<br>
<h4>Development</h4>
<p>Development for classpathx occurs on the 
<a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/classpathx">savannah</a>
free software collaboration system. You can view our code in CVS from
there. If you want to help us you will need to become a savannah user.
</p>


<br>
<h4>Thank yous</h4>
<p>Andrew Selkirk started this project as an open source effort in
2000. He did all of the hard work creating the free versions of the various
javax APIs listed above. He was also gracious enough to hand on the
work to the GNU project when he found himself too busy to
continue. Andrew stays in touch with the project and we'd like to give a 
a <b>very</b> big thank you to Andrew for his effort, vision 
and magnanimity.
</p>

<p>David Brownell contributed the JAXP, SAX and DOM code.
With another hat, he's a maintainer for the SAX2 interfaces.
Thanks for the help David!
</p>

<p>Chris Burdess (aka dog) donated javamail providers and had to do a lot of
work converting his beautiful source code to our formatting standards.
Thanks dog!
</p>

<p>Paul Siegmann who wrote the original free version of the servlet API 
and trail blazed the legalities of the GNU project clean rooming javax
source code. Paul spent many days typing in code worked out from
javadoc. He deserves a lot of thanks, so...<br>
Lot's of thanks Paul!
