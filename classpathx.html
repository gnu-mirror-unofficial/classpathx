<p>The <i>GNU Classpath Extensions</i> project builds free versions of Sun's
java extension libraries, the packages in the <code>javax</code>
namespace. It is a companion project of the 
<a href="/software/classpath/">GNU Classpath</a> project.
</p>

<p>Classpathx produces vendor neutral java code, it should work with
any VM. However, we particularly want the code to work with free VMs
such as <a href="http://www.kaffe.org/">kaffe</a>.
</p>


<br>
<h4>We need help</h4>

<p>Attempting to build free versions of ALL of Sun's java extensions
is a big job and we need your help to get everything done. If you are
a Java programmer and you want to work on building free java
extensions then get in touch with 
<a href="mailto:nferrier@gnu.org">Nic Ferrier
(nferrier@gnu.org)</a>. He'll be happy to give you something
interesting to do!
</p>


<br>
<h4>Packages currently under development</h4>

<ul>
<li><a id="jbactivation">java beans activation framework</a><br>
The activation framework allows programmers to encapsulate access to
certain types of data.<br>
We have the API classes but no implementations yet.
<p></p>
</li>

<li><a id="jbinfobus">java bean infobus</a><br>
The infobus is a bean->bean communication system.<br>
We have the API classes but no implementations yet.
<p></p>
</li>

<li><a id="jmail">java mail</a><br>
Everything you need to send mail from a java program</br>
We have got quite a lot of the API classes for this. We also have the
following providers finished or underway:
  <ul>
  <li>POP provider</li>
  <li>IMAP provider</li>
  </ul>
<p></p>
</li>

<li><a id="servlet">servlet API</a><br>
The abstract definition of how to plug executable content into
HTTP.</br>
We have the servlet classes for version 2.3 of the API (we'd like to
produce the previous versions of these as well).<br>
There is also a GNU servlet container called 
<a href="/software/paperclips">Paperclips</a>.
<p></p>
</li>

<li><a id="jaxp">jaxp</a><br>
The java XML API.<br>
We have a SAX and DOM parser but not the API classes yet.
<p></p>
</li>

</ul>

<br>
<h4>Releases</h4>
<p>We haven't released any of this code yet. We plan to release a
number of them as soon as we have completed them. The 
<a href="#jbactivation">activation</a> and
<a href="#jbinfobus">infobus</a> packages are very near completion and
will be released first.
</p>

<br>
<h4>Development</h4>
<p>Development for classpathx occurs on the 
<a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/classpathx">savannah</a>
free software collaboration system. You can view our code in CVS from
there. If you want to help us you will need to become a savannah user.
</p>

<p><b>Note as of 16th May 2001:</b><br>
Please note that code is not yet in CVS. Classpathx has only
just been approved by the GNU project and we haven't had a chance to
add the code yet!</p>


<br>
<h4>Thank yous</h4>
<p>Andrew Selkirk started this project as an open source effort in
2000. He did all of the hard work creating the free versions of the various
javax APIs listed above. He was also gracious enough to hand on the
work to the GNU project when he found himself too busy to
continue. Andrew stays in touch with the project and we'd like to give a 
a <b>very</b> big thank you to Andrew for his effort, vision 
and magnanimity.
